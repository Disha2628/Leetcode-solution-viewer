LeetCode Solution Viewer

A web application to fetch and display LeetCode solutions in multiple programming languages.

Overview
This project utilizes a public GitHub API repository to provide solutions for LeetCode problems. Users can search for solutions by problem name or number and toggle between four different programming languages: C++, Java, Python, and Go.

Features
- Search for LeetCode solutions by problem name or number
- Toggle between four programming languages: C++, Java, Python, and Go
- Fetch solutions from a public GitHub API repository
- Clean and responsive UI for an optimal user experience

Technologies Used
- Front-end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- API: Public GitHub API repository

How it Works
1. Users input a LeetCode problem name or number into the search bar.
2. The application sends a request to the public GitHub API repository to fetch the corresponding solution.
3. The solution is then displayed on the webpage, with the option to toggle between four programming languages.

Future Development
- Expand the solution repository to include more LeetCode problems
- Implement a rating system for solutions
- Add support for additional programming languages

Getting Started
To run the application locally:

1. Clone the repository using git clone https://github.com/Disha2628/Leetcode-solution-viewer.git
